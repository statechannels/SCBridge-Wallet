## Demo script:

- ERC-4337 compatible Smart Contract wallet
- Unique feature: gasless off-chain txs with instant finality enabled by HTLC technology, as used in Bitcoin Lightning
- Setup required:
  - wallet owners must designate an Intermediary in their SC wallet
  - wallet owners and Intermediary must sign-off on some amount of wallet funds designated for off-chain txs
  - run in-browser client to interact with SC wallet and peers
  - `Explain browser tab setup with Alice(left), Irene(middle), Bob(right)`
- How it works:
  - on-chain txs are 2/2 multi-sig (user + intermediary)
  - `Show on-chain tx from Alice to Metamask account`
  - user can remove intermediary at any point to claim full ownership of wallet/funds
  - `Point to 'Eject' button on UI`
  - off-chain payments are multisig between payor, intermediary, and payee
  - off-chain payments require users to be connected to the same intermediary (or have a path to each other through multiple intermediaries)
  - `Show off-chain payment Alice to Bob`
- Cross-chain payments
  - works for off-chain payments only
  - Alice on Network1 can pay Bob on Network2 if the following conditions are met:
    - Alice designates some of her Network1 funds to Intermediary
    - Bob designates some of his Network2 funds Intermediary
    - Intermediary has an exchange rate to convert between Network1 funds and Network2 funds
    - Intermediary can access both Network1 and Network2 to monitor Alice & Bob balances
